# hauntedhouse1.0
A very basic python text adventure, developed within a student group at Stockton University

All control of the game is through mutltiple choice prompts the user must respond to with set phrases in order to proceed.
The game's rules are outlined in the instructions, and the win and loss states are clear.

The game is simple, but it's fun and is easy to jump into and play for a nice quick distraction.

We hope you enjoy!
